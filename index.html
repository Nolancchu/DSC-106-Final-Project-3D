                    So far, our team has made fairly great progress. We spent about two to three hours preprocessing the data, which included data cleaning/organization, in addition to performing some exploratory data analysis. During our EDA, we explored trends like heart rate, temperature, and BVP over time for different students over various exams. Afterwards, based on the conclusions of our EDA, we came up with some visualization ideas. We ended up deciding on a storyboard-style visualization in which the user scrolls through different slides to learn about which factors lead to good/bad grades; this story will be told using specific students in the dataset who performed poorly/well. We created a basic template for the storyboard, and added the ability for the user to scroll through the slides. <br>
                    <br><b>What will be the most challenging of your project to design, and why?</b> <br>
                    One of the most challenging aspects of our project will be designing the interactive storyboard in a way that effectively conveys insights while keeping users engaged. Since we are using real students’ data to tell a story, we need to ensure that the transitions between slides feel seamless, and that the visual elements clearly highlight key trends, such as the relationship between physiological signals and exam performance. Another challenge will be optimizing the interactivity – making sure that users can explore different variables (e.g., heart rate, BVP, and grades) without overwhelming them with too much information at once. Finally, balancing aesthetics with clarity will be difficult, as we need to create a visually compelling experience while maintaining readability, and avoiding clutter in our explanations.</p>
