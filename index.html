      <p>
        <b>What have you done so far?</b><br>
        So far, our team has made fairly great progress. We spent about two to three hours preprocessing the data, which included data cleaning/organization, in addition to performing some exploratory data analysis. During our EDA, we explored trends like heart rate, temperature, and BVP over time for different students over various exams. Afterwards, based on the conclusions of our EDA, we came up with some visualization ideas. We ended up deciding on a stress simulator; we will be utilizing the heart rate of students during the duration of exams to determine how stress affects the grades students receive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What will be the most challenging part of your project to design, and why?</b><br>
        One of the most challenging aspects of our project will be ensuring the real-time visualization effectively communicates the relationship of heart rate with exam performance. The heart rate animation, as well as the updating tooltip, must smoothly track/display data without overwhelming the user. Additionally, balancing interactivity, such as switching between students or highlighting their performance, while maintaining a clean, intuitive design will be difficult. Finally, ensuring the visualization is both visually engaging/informative without cluttering the chart or obscuring key insights will require careful design/testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Motivation</b><br>
        Exams are some of the most stressful experiences students face, yet we rarely understand how stress truly affects different types of performers. Are high achievers naturally calm under pressure, or do they feel the weight of expectations more intensely? Do struggling students experience stress differently, and how does it impact their performance? At what points during exams do students experience the most stress? Finding these answers is important, as stress isn’t just a number -- it's a lived experience that shapes how students learn, perform, and grow. Our visualization goes beyond simple static charts or numbers, using real-time heart rate data to reveal the hidden story of stress during exams. Unlike traditional visualizations, ours allows users to interactively explore stress patterns across different performance groups/exam stages, offering a dynamic, intuitive way to understand the data. By combining interactive elements with real-time insights, we provide a tool that not only informs but also engages, helping educators, as well as students, see stress in a whole new light. We aim to spark conversations about how we can better support students in managing stress in order to unlock their full potential.
